         <h2>Between Two Presidents</h2>
         <p>Despite everything he'd been through, finding out about Lincoln's assassination was quite possibly the worst moment of Grant's life. Just when he believed peace was within reach, it was stolen away by a single man. 
         <p>It was up to the Vice President, Andrew Johnson, a man only selected to balance the electoral ticket, to clean up the fallout of America's bloodiest war. Johnson and Grant got along well enough at first, though they had separate ideologies, Johnson being a Democrat who had comparatively little care for the newly freed slaves, and Grant, who often sided with the Radical Republicans, had just risked his life to free them.</p>
         <p>Regardless, Grant attempted to serve Johnson just as honorably as he had Lincoln. This lasted for a time. Johnson certainly had the hardest 
         job in the world and it's difficult to not have some sympathy for him. However, he lacked the determination and resolution that Lincoln had. Johnson seemed to focus on appeasing the nation and practicing good politics instead of bettering life for the people; the actions may have looked similar, but the goal made the subtle difference. After all, to attempt to please everyone will please no one.</p>
         <p>Grant felt no differently than the common-folk, and by this time, had several personal disputes with Johnson himself. While Johnson launched several public appeals to increase his favorability, including going on tour with Grant, his popularity plummeted while Grant's only rose.</p>
         <p>Eventually, thoroughly disappointed in Johnson, the country was ready for something else, and the Republicans knew exactly who to put forward: Ulysses S. Grant, the famous war hero and Lincoln's trusted companion.</p>
         <p>Grant was apprehensive to the role, perhaps rightfully recognizing his lack of political experience, but also recognized that, when the nation called upon him again, he felt duty-bound to step up to the task. He won in a landslide.</p>

         <h2>Fighting a New War</h2>
         <p>Grant's presidency, if anything, was marked by two defining forces: his aggressive stance for human rights and the corruption and scandals of his administration.</p>
         <p>Grant's job was perhaps even more difficult than Johnson's, as Johnson had quite possibly only made things worse. Regardless, Grant stepped up with aplomb... and was widely criticized.</p>
         <p>History does not often look favorably upon Grant's presidency, and yet there's plenty to respect. Among many other things, Grant stood up adamantly for all people, despite the times. He mostly viewed everyone, regardless of race or gender, as equals to the law.</p>
         <p>While he certainly seemed to attempt Johnson-esque compromise at times, Grant was not afraid of utilizing force to ensure his agenda was implemented. He appointed men to his cabinet that actively hunted the Ku Klux Klan, instated laws that vehemently protected former slaves, and even sent federal troops to the South to ensure the results of the war were maintained at any cost.
         <p>This held for a while, but caused growing animosity in the Democrats who felt oppressed. Additionally, Grant's aggression even turned away some Republicans, who opposed him as the "Liberal Republicans", desiring more liberal freedom above all else, and thus attempted to take him down through their own candidate, which resulted in abject failure. The population at large was still on Grant's side.</p>
         <p>Regardless, Grant, being the great general he was, was fairly proficient at making enemies, and in politics, enemies make life significantly more difficult.</p>
         <p>Grant's treatment of the office of the presidency as a military operation only complicated things further, allowing for plenty of scandals and corruption that, unfortunately, granted truth to his enemies' words.</p>
         
         <h2>The General's Weakness</h2>
         <p>While pretty much anyone would tell you today that Grant was a man of honor and integrity until the very end, this may have ended up being his downfall.</p>
         <p>His loyalty to his friends was admirable until his friends were committing crimes with the very power Grant entrusted them with. This led to an endless cycle of Grant hiring one of his loyal friends or allies to a powerful position, trusting them with everything, only to find out they had abused their power, made enemies with other powerful people, took the money or influence, and resigned, or were inevitably otherwise dismissed, only to be replaced with another trusted confidant who would, almost certainly, for whatever reason, do the exact same thing.</p>
         <p>Grant was often stuck between a rock and a hard place, as his very own friends, allies, or even fellow war heroes were often very obviously guilty. Usually, he would feel obligated to condemn them, though sometimes he would feel his loyalty to the man himself came first and would unquestionably and unprecedentedly pardon them. Grant was forced into dozens of impossible choices that would hurt his image no matter what option he chose.</p>
         <p>Regardless of the moral perspective, either outcome was not a good look for the president of the United States, and gave plenty of ammunition to Grant's enemies, those of which who wanted to see the North defeated and South sovereignty reinstated and those who simply wanted their own form of power reclaimed.</p>
         <p>Grant's political inexperience also led to blatant misunderstandings of extremely important matters, such as the economy and foreign policy, thus leading him to put even more trust in men that perhaps never should've held an office of even modest responsibility, much less one of the highest offices in the world.</p>
         <p>These scandals would lead to the unfortunate fact that Grant's incredible legacy was tarnished and largely overshadowed by the rumors and reality of corruption. Perhaps it's a testament to his legacy that Grant gets to be remembered for his service as general moreso than his presidency.</p>

         <h2>Grant's Final Battle</h2>
         <p>Despite the rampant and perhaps even exaggerated reports of scandals, corruption, drinking and excessive force, Grant was still largely viewed as a national hero, and most of the nation held great respect for him.</p>
         <p>It's certainly true that his legacy became far more tarnished as time went on than when the problems were actually happening. It's notable that World War I in particular seemed to damage his reputation the most, bringing back the memories of the lives lost under Grant's "reckless" behavior in the Civil War.</p>
         <p>Subsequent presidents' scandals also caused many Americans to look back at Grant's administration with frustration, perhaps wondering if that was where it all began. Some historians have even claimed Grant's military career was one of luck, not skill, and his lackluster presidency proves it.</p>
         <p>In recent years, however, historians are once again examining his life, and his popularity has begun to rebound. Perhaps a result of a pendulum swing, or perhaps the softened judgment that peace affords is enough to view his actions more sympathetically.</p>
         <p>Regardless, perhaps what is most important is how Grant viewed himself. He was diagnosed with throat cancer in June of 1884. This set fire to his will to write his memoirs, which, through the help of Mark Twain, were published as two books that are still considered some of the greatest works of history ever written to this day.</p>
         <p>Within them the world can see a man who was realistic and critical of his life. Grant clearly felt incredibly complex feelings about his time as general and president, accurately assessing the good he accomplished while not shying away from his mistakes.</p>
         <p>Even as he was dying, his thoughts went to his family, as he struggled with financial difficulties and would have nothing to leave them. His memoirs would be finished three days before his death on July 23, 1885. Twain then saw that they were published.</p>
         <p>They were an instant hit and sold in record-breaking numbers, resulting in Grant's wife, Julia, receiving $450,000 in royalties, the equivalent of $12 million dollars as of 2020. With this, Grant's family could financially rest peacefully.</p>
         <p>Grant's wife and children would fight for his legacy after his death, extremely proud of what their husband and father had accomplished, believing that, regardless of anything else, he was, unequivocally, exactly the right man at exactly the right time for their proud, now appropriately united, United States of America.</p>
