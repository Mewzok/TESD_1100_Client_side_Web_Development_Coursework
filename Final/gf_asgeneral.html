      <h1>General Grant</h1>
      <img src="resources/generalgrant.png" alt="" />
      <h2>From Obscurity to Command</h2>
      <p>In the crucible of the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant didn't just lead the Union to victory, but also cemented himself as one of the 
         greatest generals in world history.
         
            Ulysses S. Grant had already fought in the Mexican-American War and was plenty familiar with battle. 
         His limitations would truly be tested during the Civil War, however, when he eventually received command over 
         the entire U.S. army, becoming second only to the president. His rise was not immediate however, nor was his 
         story an entirely successful one, with many self-proclaimed mistakes and more than a few detractors. One way or another, 
         however, Grant would find his footing and push onwards, becoming known to history as perhaps the most prominent reason 
         for the union victory and thus the appropriately united United States that we have today.
      </p>
      <h2>Logistics, Loyalty and Leadership</h2>
      <p>   Given Grant's prior experience, he had hoped for a relatively senior rank from the start. Although his early efforts were rejected, 
         perhaps even by Major General George B McClellan himself, who Grant would famously take the place of no less, Grant still managed to worm his way in to a leadership 
         position through the help of Congressman Elihu B. Washburne of Illinois. Though a humble position, leading the 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, Grant took 
         to his role with aplomb, expertly instilling discipline and respect into this rowdy and untrained group of men and leading them to win important battles for the Union. 
         Grant gained promotions and his fame increased as he masterfully used whatever he had to win the advantage. Even when Grant retreated, he did so in a way that prudently 
         gave his volunteer soldiers much needed experience and thus built their confidence for the next fight. Grant was exceedingly aggressive, attempting strategies often turned 
         down by senior commanders, and while his tactics didn't always work, Grant almost always managed to find the best way to fail, making him notable amongst other Union commanders, 
         even during their loss streaks. Grant's capture of Fort Donelson and John B. Floyd's entire army of 12,000-15,000 troops signified the first major Union victory, an achievement 
         that greatly frustrated his own commander, Henry Halleck, due to Grant's acting without authorization. Halleck complained to McClellan, accusing Grant of "neglect and inefficiency". 
         Interestingly, President Lincoln didn't seem to see it that way, as he promoted Grant to major general of the volunteers, and Grant become increasingly popular among the citizenry. 
      </p>
      <h2>Rightful Authority</h2>
      <p>   At the urging of Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Halleck reluctantly reinstated Grant, who spent much of his time drilling his troops instead of preparing 
         fortifications. Grant continued to make the best of bad situations, getting caught off-guard yet still turning the fight into a stalemate, accepting orders from incompetent 
         higher-ups and finding ways to make it work. Grant was proving to be crafty, clever, and unafraid, as all the best generals should be, making himself stand out among the current 
         leaders in charge, who were often afraid of large casualties, failed strategies, and ran by-the-numbers tactics that cost them more than was gained. Though Grant's successes were great, 
         they were often costly as well, as public opinion began to turn. Grant was accused of using the lives of his men as pawns, sacrificing them by the thousands for strategic gain. 
         And they were right. Whether Grant was right or wrong depends on the importance of winning the war, and he was willing to do whatever it takes. Regardless, Lincoln dismissed Grant's 
         critics, recognizing that, while the cost was great, Grant was perhaps the most effective man he had. Grant gained several more victories, including through the use of political and 
         tactical strategies like incorporating freed slaves into his army and cutting off his men from supplies for a surprise attack, relying only on foraging the land, gaining more and more 
         respect from Lincoln, who finally decided Grant needed a promotion; Grant would be given the position of lieutenant general, thus allowing him command of all Union Armies. This rank was 
         only previously held by George Washington himself.
      </p>
      <h2>Grant's Final March</h2>
      <p>   Grant continued his brutal battles, at best masterfully maneuvering a successful campaign to take important Confederate positions, and at worst losing in such a way that the cost was 
         reduced and the Union would not be broken. Though the Union under Grant almost always lost more men than the Confederates, Grant knew this was, perhaps, the Union's only and greatest advantage: 
         Union men could be replaced far more readily than Confederate men. While this may be a gruesome reality, Grant knew this fact was often key to victory, though it burdened him greatly, often losing sleep over casualties. Grant supposedly privately wept as he sent more men to the slaughter.
         Despite this, Grant's aggressive tactics and constant attacks led to rapidly diminishing Confederate morale, a boon Grant would consistently attempt to abuse. Even still, Grant would offer temporary peace to his enemies so that both sides could 
         tend to the wounded, an offer that the Confederates refused. Grant knew the only way to peace was the utter obliteration of the Confederacy. Thus, he continued his campaigns, running costly offensives 
         to destroy his enemies' numbers while prediodically defending the capital, working alongside other generals like William T. Sherman and his famous Scorched Earth campaign to destroy not just the South's 
         soldiers, but also their supplies, fortifications, and, perhaps most importantly, their will to fight. The war of attrition proved more and more in Grant's favor, and after several clever moves, crushing the 
         Confederates on all sides, cutting off any escape and even burning the farms, railroads and towns Confederate soldiers once called home, Robert E. Lee, the overall general of the Confederate army, personally surrendered to Grant at Appomattox 
         Court House on April 9, 1865, thus symbolizing the end of the Civil War and placing Grant in the halls of history as one of the greatest generals to ever live. His fame wouldn't come from brute force or even particularly 
         individual genius moves, but instead his ability to recognize the situation and work to maximize success and minimize failure with what he had.
