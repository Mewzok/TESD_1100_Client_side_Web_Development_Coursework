      <h1>General Grant</h1>
      <img src="resources/generalgrant.png" alt="" />
      <h2>From Obscurity to Command</h2>
      <p>In the crucible of the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant didn't just lead the Union to victory-he cemented himself as one of the greatest generals in world history.</p>
      <p>Grant had already fought in the Mexican-American War and was no stranger to battle. His limitations would truly be tested during the Civil War, however, when he eventually received command over the entire U.S. army, becoming second only to the president. His rise was not immediate, nor was it without failure, with many self-proclaimed mistakes and more than a few detractors.</p>
      <p>Still, Grant would find his footing and push onwards, becoming known to history as perhaps the most prominent reason for the Union victory-and by extension, the appropriately united United States that we have today.</p>

      <h2>Logistics, Loyalty and Leadership</h2>
      <p>Given Grant's prior experience, he had hoped for a senior position from the start. Although his early efforts were rejected-perhaps even by Major General George B. McClellan himself, who Grant would famously take the place of no less-Grant still his way into command thanks to Congressman Elihu B. Washburne of Illinois.</p>
      <p>Though a humble position, leading the 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, Grant took to his role with conviction, expertly instilling discipline and respect into this rowdy and untrained group of men and leading them to win important battles for the Union. Grant gained promotions and his fame increased as he masterfully demonstrated a unique ability to use limited resources to his advantage.</p>
      <p>Even in retreat, he did so in a way that prudently gave his volunteer soldiers much needed experience and thus built their confidence for the next fight. Grant was typically exceedingly aggressive, attempting strategies that often clashed with the caution of senior commanders, but they stood out in a time when the Union suffered frequent setbacks, making him notable amongst other Union commanders. Grant's capture of Fort Donelson and John B. Floyd's entire army of 12,000-15,000 troops signified the first major Union victory, an achievement that interestingly earned the ire of his own commander, Henry Halleck, due to Grant's acting without authorization, accusing him of "neglect and inefficiency".</p>
      <p>President Lincoln, however, apparently saw things differently, as he promoted Grant to major general of the volunteers, and public support began to rise.</p>

      <h2>Rightful Authority</h2>
      <p>At the urging of Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Halleck reluctantly reinstated Grant, who spent much of his time drilling his troops instead of preparing 
         fortifications. Grant continued to make the best of bad situations, getting caught off-guard yet still turning the fight into a stalemate, accepting orders from incompetent 
         higher-ups and finding ways to make it work. Grant was proving to be crafty, clever, and unafraid, as all the best generals should be, making himself stand out among the current 
         leaders in charge, who were often afraid of large casualties, failed strategies, and ran by-the-numbers tactics that cost them more than was gained. Though Grant's successes were great, 
         they were often costly as well, as public opinion began to turn. Grant was accused of using the lives of his men as pawns, sacrificing them by the thousands for strategic gain. 
         And they were right. Whether Grant was right or wrong depends on the importance of winning the war, and he was willing to do whatever it takes. Regardless, Lincoln dismissed Grant's 
         critics, recognizing that, while the cost was great, Grant was perhaps the most effective man he had. Grant gained several more victories, including through the use of political and 
         tactical strategies like incorporating freed slaves into his army and cutting off his men from supplies for a surprise attack, relying only on foraging the land, gaining more and more 
         respect from Lincoln, who finally decided Grant needed a promotion; Grant would be given the position of lieutenant general, thus allowing him command of all Union Armies. This rank was 
         only previously held by George Washington himself.
      </p>
      <h2>Grant's Final March</h2>
      <p>   Grant continued his brutal battles, at best masterfully maneuvering a successful campaign to take important Confederate positions, and at worst losing in such a way that the cost was 
         reduced and the Union would not be broken. Though the Union under Grant almost always lost more men than the Confederates, Grant knew this was, perhaps, the Union's only and greatest advantage: 
         Union men could be replaced far more readily than Confederate men. While this may be a gruesome reality, Grant knew this fact was often key to victory, though it burdened him greatly, often losing sleep over casualties. Grant supposedly privately wept as he sent more men to the slaughter.
         Despite this, Grant's aggressive tactics and constant attacks led to rapidly diminishing Confederate morale, a boon Grant would consistently attempt to abuse. Even still, Grant would offer temporary peace to his enemies so that both sides could 
         tend to the wounded, an offer that the Confederates refused. Grant knew the only way to peace was the utter obliteration of the Confederacy. Thus, he continued his campaigns, running costly offensives 
         to destroy his enemies' numbers while prediodically defending the capital, working alongside other generals like William T. Sherman and his famous Scorched Earth campaign to destroy not just the South's 
         soldiers, but also their supplies, fortifications, and, perhaps most importantly, their will to fight. The war of attrition proved more and more in Grant's favor, and after several clever moves, crushing the 
         Confederates on all sides, cutting off any escape and even burning the farms, railroads and towns Confederate soldiers once called home, Robert E. Lee, the overall general of the Confederate army, personally surrendered to Grant at Appomattox 
         Court House on April 9, 1865, thus symbolizing the end of the Civil War and placing Grant in the halls of history as one of the greatest generals to ever live. His fame wouldn't come from brute force or even particularly 
         individual genius moves, but instead his ability to recognize the situation and work to maximize success and minimize failure with what he had.
