      <h1>Grant Facts</h1>
      <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Grant's real name is Hiram Ulysses Grant. A clerical error resulted in his name being misrecorded as
            "Ulysses S. Grant" and the name stuck.
         </li>
         <li>The name "Ulysses" was drawn by random chance through ballots in a hat.</li>
         <li>Grant was born on April 27th, 1822 in Point Pleasant, Ohio.</li>
         <li>Grant was the eldest child with 5 siblings, Simpson, Clara, Orvil, Jennie and Mary.</li>
         <li>Grant was not forced to attend church and never joined any denomination, but prayed privately for his entire life.</li>
         <li>Grant was an incredibly talented horseman at a young age, granting him unique job oppurtunities and a reputation 
            as the "most proficient" horseman in the military.
         </li>
         <li>Grant was supposedly capable of performing bareback stunts on horseback starting at age 5.</li>
         <li>When he was still young, neighbors would often request Grant to train their particilarly hard-to-handle horses.</li>
         <li>Grant was painfully average at school, excelling only in math and drawing.</li>
         <li>Grant graduated from West Point in 1843, ranking 21st out of 39 cadets.</li>
         <li>Grant's father, Jesse Root Grant, was originally a Jacksonian Democrat. However, he eventually broke with 
            the party as he began to support the abolitionist cause.
         </li>
         <li>Grant's father was elected mayor in two different towns in Ohio, Georgetown and Bethel.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Military Career</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Grant was nominated to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York by Representative Thomas L. Hamer
            at his father's request. Hamer was unfamiliar with Grant, so he enlisted him under the name "U.S. Grant."
            The initials "U.S." were often used for "Uncle Sam", thus Grant became known as Sam among his colleagues.
         </li>
         <li>Grant fought in the Mexican-American war, serving under Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott.
            Taylor would become the 12th U.S. President and Scott would become a presidential nominee, ultimately losing
            to Democrat Franklin Pierce.
         </li>
         <li>Grant was appointed colonel of the 21st Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry at the start of the Civil War.</li>
      </ul>
