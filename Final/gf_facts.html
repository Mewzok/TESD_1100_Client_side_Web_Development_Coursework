            <div class="factCard">
               <li>Grant's real name is Hiram Ulysses Grant. A clerical error resulted in his name being misrecorded as
                  "Ulysses S. Grant" and the name stuck.
               </li>
            </div>
            <div class="factCard">
               <li>The name "Ulysses" was drawn by random chance through ballots in a hat.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="factCard">
               <li>Grant was the eldest child with 5 siblings, Simpson, Clara, Orvil, Jennie and Mary.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="factCard">
               <li>Grant was not forced to attend church as a child and never joined any denomination, but prayed privately for his entire life.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="factCard">
               <li>Grant was an incredibly talented horseman at a young age, granting him unique job oppurtunities and a reputation 
                  as the "most proficient" horseman in the military.
               </li>
            </div>
            <div class="factCard">
               <li>Grant was supposedly capable of performing bareback stunts on horseback starting at age 5.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="factCard">
               <li>When he was still young, neighbors would often request Grant to train their particilarly hard-to-handle horses.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="factCard">
               <li>Grant was painfully average at school, excelling only in math and drawing.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="factCard">
               <li>Grant graduated from West Point in 1843, ranking 21st out of 39 cadets.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="factCard">
               <li>Grant's father, Jesse Root Grant, was originally a Jacksonian Democrat. However, he eventually broke with 
                  the party as he began to support the abolitionist cause.
               </li>
            </div>
            <div class="factCard">
               <li>Grant's father was elected mayor in two different towns in Ohio, Georgetown and Bethel.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="factCard">
               <li>Grant seemed to gravitate toward art, studying under Robert Walter Weir and producing several works, some
                  of which have survived to this day.
               </li>
            </div>
            <li>Grant was considered to be quiet and reserved, only making a few friends but having a close relationship 
               with them.
            </li>
            <li>Grant initially intended to only serve out a four-year term in the service, excited to leave as soon as 
               possible and enter into a possible career of teaching.
            </li>
            <li>Grant married Julia Dent, who was the sister of one of his closest friends and fellow cadet at the academy, 
               Frederick Dent.</li>
            <li>Neither of Grant's parents, who were strict abolitionists, attended Grant's wedding, as his wife Julia's family
               owned slaves.</li>
            <li>Grant and Julia had four children: Frederick, Ulysses Jr., Ellen, and Jesse II. Grant would decide to
               remain in the army to support his wife and children.
            </li>
            <li>Grant was nominated to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York by Representative Thomas L. Hamer
               at his father's request. Hamer was unfamiliar with Grant, so he enlisted him under the name "U.S. Grant."
               The initials "U.S." were often used for "Uncle Sam", thus Grant became known as Sam among his colleagues.
            </li>
            <li>Grant fought in the Mexican-American war, serving under Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott.
               Taylor would become the 12th U.S. President and Scott would become a presidential nominee, ultimately losing
               to Democrat Franklin Pierce.
            </li>
            <li>Grant was unsatisfied with non-combat roles in the military.</li>
            <li>Grant once volunteered to deliver a message past a group of snipers, hanging off the side of his horse, putting
               it between himself and the snipers, demonstrating his excellent equestrian abilities.
            </li>
            <li>Upon Grant's successful attack on Fort Donelson, the remaining Confederate commander Simon Bolivar Buckner
               attempted to negotiate. Grant's only demand was for "unconditional and immediate surrender," thus earning him
               the nickname "Unconditional Surrender Grant," a play on his initials.
            </li>
            <li>In 1866, Grant was promoted to a brand new rank in the military created for him, "General of the Army." A new, 
               higher rank has been created since, "General of the Armies," which was posthumously conferred onto him in 
               2024. Only three people have held this rank to this day, John J. Pershing, George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant.
            </li>
            <li>Grant signed the bill establishing Yellowstone as the first National Park in 1872.</li>
            <li>Grant established the Department of Justice, ordering them to protect the recently freed African Americans,
               especially from the still active Ku Klux Klan.
            </li>
            <li>Grant signed the bill into law that established Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day as federal 
               holidays in June 1870.
            </li>
            <li>Grant took on the Ku Klux Klan, even mobilizing federal troops against them.</li>
            <li>Grant's administration was famously plagued by scandals, dampening his reputation in history.</li>
            <li>When Grant left office, he toured the world, becoming the first president to circumnavigate the globe.</li>
            <li>Grant was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer, and thus vigorously wrote his memoirs. Mark Twain 
               famously provided literary advice, proof-reading, and even helped Grant publish them. They became an instant 
               bestseller, the publishing company Charles Webster Publishing writing the largest royalty check ever written 
               at that time of $200,000 dollars. The Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant are commonly considered some of the best 
               written books ever created by a former president and are still produced today.
            </li>
            <li>Grant is entombed in Grant's Tomb in New York City, which is the largest mausoleum in North America.</li>
            <li>Grant is well known for his lifelong battle with alcohol, which supposedly concerned many throughout his military career. 
               It's undeniable that Grant binge drank occasionally, however there's much debate about whether it was enough to be 
               considered a real problem. Many today suggest it never intereferred with his abilities or work and was relatively tame 
               compared to our typical image of alcoholism.
            </li>
            <li>Along with the reality, or perhaps half-truths, of Grant's drinking, Lincoln, while initially cauteous, become far more impressed with Grant's 
               military capabilities. Famously, when asked to address Grant's drinking problem, Lincoln supposedly commanded his men to, 
               "find out what brand of whiskey Grant drank," so that he could, "send a barrel of it to all the other commanders." 
               While a humorous story, it's possible that it's only partially true if it ever happened at all. There are many debates 
               to this day as to if this event actually happened. There's no debate, however, that Lincoln admired Grant's skills 
               and was more than willing to look past his "alcoholism" to put them to use.
            </li>
            <li>Grant disliked military uniforms and would often wear civilian clothing, muddy boots, and a private's coat with 
               his rank simply stitched onto it, even as a commanding general.
            </li>
            <li>Grant has possibly been arrested, perhaps even more than once. While these incidents are shrouded 
               in ambiguity, Grant supposedly enjoyed the thrill of high speeds on his horse and was skeptical as to whether he 
               could even legally be arrested. Regardless, apparently, when dealing with the officers and judges he approached 
               them good-naturedly.
            </li>
            <li>Grant is on the $50 bill.</li>
            <li>While not directly about Grant, his administration's scandals led to quite possibly the most chaotic presidential 
               election in U.S. history. Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel Tilden vied for the presidency, and 
               while the candidates themselves were typically well-mannered and good natured, their parties did anything and everything 
               to take the White House. The Republicans owned the media and wrote slanderous articles about Tilden, while the Democrats 
               harrassed and attacked the Republicans, even utilizing the Ku Klux Klan as an unofficial arm of the Democratic party 
               to intimidate Republicans, preventing many of them from voting. In the end, neither candidate had enough votes to win, 
               and several states were disputed, some electors even refusing to cast their ballots due to perceived unfairness or corruption. 
               A special council was created to determine the next president, split upon party lines. In the end, it fell to one man, 
               Justice Joseph P. Bradley, to be the tie breaker and determine the presidency. In the end, a compromise was reached: the 
               Republicans would remove their federal militias from the south. In exchange, they would gain the presidency, electing 
               Rutherford B. Hayes to the white house, ending one of the most insane political events in history that most Americans will 
               never hear about once.
