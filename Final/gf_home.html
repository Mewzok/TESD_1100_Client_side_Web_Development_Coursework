      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Athletes are the foundation of every successful training program. 
         The best coach is an experienced ‎guide who begins with each athlete's 
         hopes, dreams and desires and then tailors a ‎training plan based on 
         that individuals’s current fitness and lifestyle. Since 2002, TSS ‎has 
         helped hundreds of individuals achieve success in many fitness areas. 
         The winner is not the one who finishes first but anyone who starts 
         the race and perseveres. Join us and begin exploring the possible.</p>
