1My final project will be a website about the the former Union general and U.S. president Ulysses S Grant. It will include general synopses about his time as both a general and a president, as well as some highlights of particularly interesting tactics and maneuvers that earned him his status as one of the greatest generals in world history, and finally a page for random and particularly interesting (or not) facts about him. This page will include a random fact generator to create random untrue facts about Grant, specifically because I find the idea humorous.

2. This website would be targeted toward anyone with next to no knowledge of our 18th president who wants to learn some quick information about him. It will contain two pages with relatively in-depth synopses about his two major careers for those who are more interested in something cerebral, as well as random facts for those with smaller attention spans. Using the fact generator, it will also serve the many people who desperately desire to lie about Grant on the internet for fun.

3. This website will hardly be unique outside of my personal approach, as there are plenty of examples of deep dives into historical figures, and mine won't even be particularly deep. However, the website will be tailored specifically to my desires and may provide a unique look into an iconic character that isn't often discussed. If nothing else, this website will provide an outlet for me to discuss the interestingly tragic circumstances of Grant and his life, and may allow others with similar mindsets a taste of the strange little drunkard genius that may entice them into further study.

This website may be a better option for people who don't want to read an entire Wikipedia page and would prefer a more bite-sized approach to learning about an important historical figure. While I intend on including the more necessary facts about Grant himself, I also want to include some lesser known information just somewhat related to Grant, for example, the election of 1876, an election so horribly corrupt that it was thrown out entirely. While Grant wasn't running in this election, many believe it was a direct result of the rampant corruption in his presidency, and it's a story I find fascinating that most Americans have never heard, and I find that a tragedy. This website can be an oppurtunity to help introduce people into an important yet largely forgotten portion of American history that I'm relatively passionate about.

4. Getting the general structure of the site may be relatively simple, but styling it with CSS to look professional will be a large obstacle for me, as I'm far more comfortable with numbers than aesthetics. Regardless, through trial and error I expect it can, at the very least, look presentable, and be mostly bug free. Typical HTML, CSS and JavaScript bugs will be expected, though the relative complexity compared to other projects I've completed seems minor, so at the risk of sounding naive, I'm not particularly worried about this aspect, though I will of course take precautions, such as ensuring I use standard coding practices, validating my code and programming the site incrementally.
